201x-xx-xx:
    * version 3.4
    * Scrolling some divs failed previously when using "j". Should work now. Thanks dom.lobue
    * hinttags fixes for gmail and other apps
    * Pressing Tab works correctly in hint mode when the list of hints has been filtered
    * Search history is accessible again
    * Display correct status messages when a text search reaches either end of the buffer
    * Url links in :jump list are clickable again
    * Gracefully handle unescaped regex characters in 'urlseparator' option
    * :sanitize now respects timespan values
    * add '-select' option to :tabclose command for specifiying which tab is selected after closing the current one
    * Deleting local marks with :delmarks[!] command is working now

2011-11-13:
    * version 3.3
    * Firefox 8 and 9 compatibility fixes
    * Reworked mode message handling. The mode message can be shown simultaneoulsy
      with other messages now. Also changed the visual display of a mode.
    * Single line message output with :echo are shown again

2011-06-03:
    * version 3.2
    * Compatibility fixes for Firefox 5.x and 6.x. Also bumped maxVersion accordingly
    * Make search more reliable
    * Reworked mode handling a bit. While in the end this will be much
      cleaner, it might have some regressions. Please report!
    * Better logging: :messages is now the main location for any informative
      but also error messages (apart from a few very early loading errors,
      which are still dump'ed to the console since the :messages mechanism
      might be broken/unavailable in this case).
      Also show StackTraces on internal errors to faciliate debugging
    * More consistent messages after (un)successful commands
    * Remove CSS hack to get rid of tab scrolling when you have many tabs because some
      users complained about this change. If you want to allow your tabs to shrink
      as much as possible, but this into your .vimperatorrc file:
      :js styles.addSheet(false, "mintabwidth", "chrome://*", ".tabbrowser-tab[fadein]:not([pinned]) { min-width: 16px !important; } .scrollbutton-up, .scrollbutton-down { display:none; }");
      This could make a nice vimperator plugin with a :set mintabwith=... option.
    * The heart indiciator for bookmarked pages also shows the correct
      state now when hovering over a link
    * Many small bug fixes

2011-04-21: "The Return Of Copy And Paste"
    * version 3.1
    * IMPORTANT: PASSTHROUGH mode has been reworked. Press 'i' to ignore a single
      key, and "Shift-Esc" or "Insert" to toggle vimperator completely.
    * IMPORTANT: Ctrl-c/x/v/z do their expected thing now. We managed that by just
      reshuffling some commands.
    * IMPORTANT: CARET mode is now activated with 'c' instead of 'i'
    * IMPORTANT: :viusage, :exusage and :optionusage (and the manually created
      index of all commands in the helpfile) have been replaced by a single
      :usage command.
    * IMPORTANT: The multiline output has been reworked to make it more
      clearer in which mode you are. This means, that while 'more' is the new
      default, you have to explicitly close the output window with Esc or 'q'. This
      has the advantage that you never have to guess if the next key like 'j' is
      sent to the output window or to the page in case you are at the end of the output.
      Therefore, also the 'more' option has been removed.
    * Add 'animations' option to globablly decide if you want the animations
      in our UI or not. NOTE: Not yet fully implemented for all animations.
    * Slight changes in how the completion and command output list is graphically displayed
    * Readded 'bookmark' and 'history' to the 'status' option to get the old
      information about bookmark state and back/forward possibilities from Vimperator 2.x
      Thanks lolilolicon.
    * Vimperator's command line is now a fully supported toolbar. This means you
      can just right click it, select "Customize", and drag'n drop any
      items in the command line like the combined back/forward button and
      get rid of the default address bar. Thanks caisui for the patch!
    * Boolean options can now also be set with :set option=true/false
    * Error messages have more consistent wording now, also got rid of Exxx error
      codes, as we never supported those in the help files anyway.
    * Vimperator works around Firefox's tab scrolling now. So the minimum
      tab width is now just 16px anymore, and you are much more unlikely to
      see scrollbars in the tab bar.
    * No longer show the command after executing an ex command. Just
      fade out quickly now and make room for the status items.
    * Add 'apptab' option for pin/unpin the current tab.
    * Add 'messagetimeout' option to automatically hide messages after a timeout
    * :tabclose! behavior is changed: Instead of focusing left tab, force closing
      of a tab - even if it is an AppTab.
    * Bug fixes

2011-03-06:
    * version 3.0
    * IMPORTANT: The statusbar and command line have been merged in a single
      row as also Firefox 4 hides the statusbar by default now
    * IMPORTANT: By default, we don't change Firefox's default UI anymore!
      This was done since Firefox 4 has indeed a very minimal GUI and the Firefox
      navigation toolbar (with small icons) uses hardly more space than our old status line, but
      provides so much more (easy bookmarking, better security information, ...)
    * IMPORTANT: 'guioptions' and 'showtabline' have been removed in favor of
      'toolbars', 'scrollbars' and 'tabnumbers' options!
    * IMPORTANT: Removed 'laststatus' option but add a 'status' option in contrast
      to decide which elements are shown in the new style status bar
    * IMPORTANT: Support for configurable hint characters; This basically brings back the old
      hint behavior for those who prefer it. See the 'hintchars' option. Patch by caisui
    * IMPORTANT: 'wildoptions' option was removed. Completions are sorted automatically now,
      and 'autocomplete' is the new option for the removed 'wildoptions=auto'
    * IMPORTANT: We automatically list completions as you type now. If you have a slow computer,
      you might want to :set noautocomplete
    * IMPORTANT: Tab numbers can now be set with :set [no]tabnumbers. Also made them
      work much more reliable in Firefox4 - especially in combination with other tab related
      addons like TabMixPlus
    * IMPORTANT: We do not beep on unrecognized mappings anymore, to make it easier to just
      use Firefox mappings if the user wants them
    * IMPORTANT: Removed :redraw and Ctrl-l as it just doesn't make sense to have that feature
    * IMPORTANT: 'jsdebugger' option was removed, as JS completion should work much better
      out of the box now.
    * IMPORTANT: Remove :toolbaropen, :toolbarclose and :toolbartoggle, as toolbars are now
      managed with the 'toolbars' option
    * Full Panorama support: :tabgroups can be used to deal with tab groups.
    * Add 'smallicons' option (default=true) to set small toolbar icons
    * Add 'g@' mapping for switching to an app tab.
    * Add '<C-S-n>' and '<C-S-p>' mappings for switching to the next / previous tab group.
    * Support for sub commands.
    * Added :set toolbars=addons to allow toggling of the addon-bar. Thanks garbas
    * Fixed :open sometimes selecting the wrong entry when autocompletions were turned on
      and the user quickly pressed Tab.
    * Many small fixes for Firefox4 changes
    * Lots of restyled content and changed colors (like InfoMsg and ModeMsg)
    * gu works now better for urls with anchors and GET arguments (like url.com/file?query=foo#anchor)
    * :bmarks and :history commands support multiple space separated filter entries and
      match them on both URL and title. Multi filter highlighting for results in
      the URL and title fields.
    * remove "URL (additional)" entries from the search results. Only list urls which
      match either the url or description
    * :bmarks -k[eyword] to search bookmarks by a keyword
    * Pressing Escape now clears any previous command output. Scrolling the web page, however, does NOT
      not clear it anymore (as it used to do)
    * History, bookmarks and :open output limit the width of the URL column to 50% so you can
      always see (and interact with hints) the title column as well
    * Better escape certain characters when yanking links to improve pasting in other applications
    * :dialog passwords
    * Fix hints display on some pages like stackoverflow (thanks Jez)
    * Fix relative paths in :cd
    * Support rich text editor written by HTML.
      mode is into editing mode (INSERT, TEXTAREA, VISUAL) if the focused window is editable.
      And update map [m]i[m]: into be editing mode if editable otherwise CARET mode.
    * Strings starting with a "." are no longer treated as urls by :open et.al.
    * add *-javascript* flag to [c]:abbreviate[c], [c]:iabbrev[c] and [c]:cabbrev[c].
    * :history -remove , remove history items by name/tags/url (only by date with :sanitize).
    * Add image-related hint modes: [m];x[m] for title/alt text, and [m];S[m] and [m];A[m]
      for saving.
    * Image hints now work on anything with a *src* tag.
    * Enable 'hinttags' and 'extendedhinttags' to setlocal
    * Removed :help version as it wasn't maintained anymore, and added quite a lot of size
      to the XPI. Users interested in changes can read the Release Notes on the homepage.
    * Various other bug fixing and refinement

2010-04-07:
    * version 2.3.1
    * Fix a problem in the XPI which caused problems for some users
    * gH should work with multiple homepages
    * fix 'activate' option for some values

2010-03-29:
    * version 2.3
    * remove | mapping to toggle source view, as gf already does
      exactly that and | might be of use for some future piping feature
    * add basic plugin authorship documentation
    * plugins may now provide full-fleged ':help' documentation
    * asciidoc is no longer required to build Vimperator
    * the help system is newly modularized
    * remove [c]:edit[c], [c]:tabedit[c], and [c]:winedit[c]
    * add 'jsdebugger' option - switch on/off javascript debugger service
    * add "addons", "downloads", "extoptions" and "help" to the 'activate' option.
    * add *-urls* option to mapping commands.
    * many more small bug fixes

2009-10-28:
    * version 2.2
    * IMPORTANT: Vimperator's licence has changed from the MPL/GPL/LGPL
      tri-license to the MIT license.
    * IMPORTANT: Map.flags has been replaced with individual properties.
      Mappings defined in plugins with mappings.add will need to be updated.
...................................
      E.g.
          mappings.add(...,
              { flags: Mappings.flags.ARGUMENT |
                       Mappings.flags.COUNT |
                       Mappings.flags.MOTION |
                       Mappings.flags.ALLOW_EVENT_ROUTING });
      is now
	   mappings.add(...,
               { arg: true, count: true, motion: true, route: true });
...................................
    * IMPORTANT: shifted key notation now matches Vim's behaviour. E.g. <C-a>
      and <C-A> are equivalent, to map the uppercase character use <C-S-A>.
      (this might change again, as this is REALLY inconsistent, and i don't
       know if I like copying bugs)
    * IMPORTANT: 'popups' now takes a stringlist rather than a number.

    * add [c]:winonly[c]
    * add [c]:tabattach[c]
    * add [c]:keepalt[c]
    * add [c]:styledisable[c], [c]:styleenable[c], and [c]:styletoggle[c]

    * add ! version of [c]:delbmarks[c] to delete all bookmarks
    * add [c]:toolbaropen[c], [c]:toolbarclose[c], and [c]:toolbartoggle[c]
    * make [c]:open[c] behavior match that of [c]:tabopen[c] and [c]:winopen[c]
      when no argument is specified
    * add extension related commands - [c]:extadd[c], [c]:extdelete[c],
      [c]:extdisable[c], [c]:extenable[c], [c]:extensions[c], [c]:extoptions[c]
    * add *-javascript* flag to [c]:autocommand[c]
    * add 'private' - enter private browsing mode, matching *PrivateMode*
      autocommand
    * add *-description* option to [c]:command[c]
    * command-line options are now supported via the host application's
      *-liberator* option
    * add [m];i[m] and [m];I[m] for opening image location (in new tab)
    * add [j]all.html[j] to show all help sections in a single page - available via
      [c]:helpall[c]
    * add [m];c[m] extended hint mode - open the context menu
    * add [m]@:[m] mapping - repeat the last Ex command
    * add [m]|[m] mapping - toggle between rendered and source view

2009-05-21:
    * version 2.1
    * IMPORTANT: Default value of 'complete' has been changed from "sfl" to "slf"
    * massively speed up [c]:open[c] completions
    * TabMixPlus (and other tab extensions) should work much better now
      together with Vimperator unless you [c]:set guioptions+=[nN][c]
    * remove 'preload' option. You can fake it by some custom JavaScript in your RC file.
    * add [c]:frameonly[c]
    * add [c]:stopall[c]
    * add [c]:tabdo[c]
    * add 'encoding'
    * add 'hintinputs'
    * add [c]:silent[c]
    * add [j]$MY_VIMPERATORRC[j]
    * add ' and " local marks
    * add [m]w[m] and [m]W[m] Normal mode mappings for symmetry with
      [m]o[m]/[m]O[m] and [m]t[m]/[m]T[m]
    * add [c]:messclear[c]
    * add 'maxitems'
    * as usual many small bug fixes

2009-03-28:
    * version 2.0
    * IMPORTANT: For compatibility with Vim, the 'guioptions' "b" value has been renamed
      "B". "b" now represents the bottom scrollbar.
    * IMPORTANT: [c]:set[c] now sets multiple options, as in Vim. Spaces in values
      must be quoted or escaped.
    * IMPORTANT: Due to much improved autocompletion, changed default 'complete' option
      value to "sfl", listing intelligent Firefox location bar results. Using "b" or "h"
      might cause problems/massive slowdowns, use with care!
    * IMPORTANT: AlwaysHint mode with [m];F[m] mode changed the semantics slightly.
    * IMPORTANT: command actions now take an args object, returned from
      commands.parseArgs, as their first argument. This will break any commands
      not using the args parser explicitly.  The old string value is now
      available via args.string.
    * IMPORTANT: 'verbose' is now used for message levels. Logging is
      controlled by the *extensions.liberator.loglevel* preference.
    * IMPORTANT: [c]:viusage[c] and [c]:exusage[c] now jump to the help index, use the
      special versions for the old behavior.
    * IMPORTANT: renamed Startup and Quit autocmd events to *VimperatorEnter* and
      *VimperatorLeave* respectively.
    * IMPORTANT: 'verbose' is now by default at 1, set to 0 to not show any status messages.
    * IMPORTANT: $VIMPERATOR_HOME is no longer used.

    * Selecting an <input type="file"> with hints now causes the command line to prompt
      for file input (instead of doing nothing).
    * [count][m]<C-n>[m] now goes to the [count]th next tab rather than the [count]th tab.
    * add ~/.vimperator/info/{profile}/, similar to viminfo
    * add [j]$VIMPERATOR_RUNTIME[j], [j]$VIMPERATOR_INIT[j]
    * [c]:hardcopy[c] now supports output redirection to a file on Unix and MacUnix
    * add [m];f[m] extended hint mode to focus a frame
    * add "r", "l", and "b" to 'guioptions' to toggle the scrollbars.
    * remove spaces and newlines when open urls starting with http:// or similar
      before :o http://linux .com would search for http://linux and for .com, now
      it just opens linux.com. Also handy when pasting broken urls with [m]p[m] or [m]P[m].
    * add 'wildcase' option
    * 'linkbgcolor', 'linkfgcolor', ... have been replaced with highlight
      groups, *HintElem* and *HintActive*
    * new 'followhints' option
    * [c]:buffers[c] supports a filter now to only list buffers matching filter (Vim
      incompatible, but consistent with other commands)
    * Favicon support in many places
    * add *Fullscreen* autocommmand
    * add [c]:colorscheme[c]
    * multibyte support for hints (thanks Xie&Tian)
    * add 'exrc'
    * add 'errorbells'
    * add shell command completion for [c]:![c]
    * add [c]:map <silent>[c] to prevent a mapping from being echoed (might be slow currently, however)
    * add guioptions=nN to number tabs
    * add [c]:loadplugins[c] command
    * add [m].[m] mapping
    * add [m]N%[m] normal mode command
    * add interpolation for items such as *<url>* to autocommands
    * add *-nargs*, *-complete*, *-bang*, and *-count* attribute support to [c]:command[c]
    * much improved completion support, including javascript, option, and search keyword
    * add [m]<PageUp>[m]/[m]<S-Up>[m] and [m]<PageDown>[m]/[m]<S-Down>[m] command-line mappings for
      selecting the previous and next history items
    * remove 'hintstyle', 'hlsearchstyle', 't_vb' and 'visualbellstyle' - use
      [c]:highlight {Hint,Search,Bell}[c]
    * add [c]:highlight[c]
    * add [c]:optionusage[c]
    * add [c]:doautocmd[c] and [c]:doautoall[c]
    * add [c]:style[c] and [c]:delstyle[c] commands, allow [c]:so[c] to source stylesheets
    * add *DOMLoad* autocmd event
    * add [c]:messages[c] and 'messages'
    * add [c]:runtime[c]
    * add 'runtimepath'
    * allow [m];[m] hints to work in the multiline output widget
    * add [c]:scriptnames[c]
    * add command-line completion to 'activate', 'cpt', 'defsearch', 'pageinfo',
      'newtab' and 'popups'
    * add 'helpfile' option
    * add 'wildignore' option
    * add [c]:finish[c] command
    * new events *BookmarkAdd*, *ShellCmdPost*, *VimperatorLeavePre*, *DownloadPost*
    * add 'cdpath' option
    * allow [c]:dialog[c] to open the cookies manager
    * add 'loadplugins' option
    * add count support to [m]<C-^>[m] (Kazuo)
    * add 'eventignore' option
    * add [c]:tabdetach[c] command
    * new [m];b[m] extended hint mode (thanks Daniel Schaffrath)
    * [c]:qa![c] and [c]:q![c] quit forcefully, as in Vim
    * stop macro playback on [m]<C-c>[m]
    * [c]:bmark[c] now updates a bookmark, if possible. [c]:bmark![c] adds a new one
    * [c]:dialog[c] and [c]:sidebar[c] arguments are now case-insensitive
    * many bug fixes

2008-08-16:
    * version 1.2
    * IMPORTANT: changed [c]:command[c] to behave like Vim's version.
...................................
      Eg. An alert command specified previously as
          :command AlertMe alert(args)
      should now be defined as
          :command AlertMe :js alert(<args>)
...................................
    * IMPORTANT: changed (again) the default keybinding to temporarily disable all
      Vimperator keybindings from [m]<C-q>[m] to [m]<C-z>[m] since many users complained
      about hitting [m]<C-q>[m] twice and exiting Vimperator
    * IMPORTANT: removed old [c]:buffers![c] buffer window, as it was ugly and slightly broken
      use [m]B[m] or [c]:buffers[c] instead
    * IMPORTANT: input fields are not blured anymore by default after a page has loaded
      use [c]:set [no]focuscontent[c] to control the behavior (thanks Paul Sobey for the
      generous donation which made this behavior possible)
    * IMPORTANT: [m]<C-x>[m]/[m]<C-a>[m] never take possible negative URLs into account, it was just
      too unpredictable
    * performance fix by using cached history, should save about 5ms on each pageload
    * add [c]:emenu[c] for accessing the Firefox main menu items from the command line
    * add 'shell' and 'shellcmdflag' options
    * [c]:tabprevious[c], [c]:bprevious[c], [c]:tabnext[c], [c]:bnext[c] and friends now accept a prefix count
    * add [c]:comclear[c] and [c]:delcommand[c]
    * add a special version to [c]:hardcopy[c] to skip the Print dialog
    * add [c]:bl[ast][c], [c]:bf[irst][c], [c]:br[ewind][c] to go to first/last tab
    * add [c]:bn[ext][c], [c]:bp[revious][c], [c]:bN[ext][c] to switch to next/previous tab
    * add [c]:pagestyle[c] command to allow for switching between alternate style sheets
    * add [c]:b[c]# to select the alternate buffer
    * add [c]:tabduplicate[c] command
    * new 'urlseparator' option for specifying the regex used to split the arg to
      [c]:open[c], [c]:tabopen[c] and [c]:winopen[c]
    * 'editor' now accepts quoting/escaping to use an editor with spaces in the path
    * support for *:%foo* as a count for commands (not yet widely used)
    * show informative message when a background tab was loaded, especially useful
      with a hidden tab bar.
    * new "l" flag for 'complete' to reuse the Firefox awesome bar for getting better
      completions for [c]:open[c]. Works only when 'wildoptions' contains "auto" and can
      be a little buggy if you are typing too fast.
    * new 'wildoptions' option (default off for now), to automatically list
      completions without the need to press the tab key
    * new argument parser for Ex commands, should tell better error messages when
      you do things like [c]:bmark -tag=a,b[c] instead of [c]:bmark -tags=a,b[c]
    * some option values can be tab-completed now; e.g., [c]:set wim=<tab>[c]
    * [c]:bdelete[c] accepts an optional argument now
    * renamed some [c]:autocmd[c], mainly BrowserStartup -> Startup and BrowserExit -> Quit
    * don't pass certain keys like [m]<C-o>[m] or [m]<C-n>[m] to Firefox in insert mode
    * keywords in [c]:open <arg>[c] have higher priority than local files now
    * add 'online' to control the "work offline" menu item
    * add [c]:jumps[c] command to list current tab's history
    * add [c]:setlocal[c] & [c]:setglobal[c] commands, so options can be local (per tab) & global
    * many small bug fixes

2008-06-03:
    * version 1.1
    * IMPORTANT: security update for suggest engines
    * try to add .exe automatically to filenames on windows, so [c]:set editor=gvim -f[c]
      will automatically invoke gvim.exe (if it's in the path). Thanks to
      Guido Van Hoecke
    * readded 'visualbellstyle' (thanks mauke)
    * new 'popups' option
    * many bug fixes as usual

2008-05-14:
    * version 1.0
    * IMPORTANT: THIS VERSION ONLY WORKS WITH FIREFOX 3.0 beta3 or newer
    * IMPORTANT: Major hints rewrite
      read up the new help for the [m]f[m], [m]F[m] and [m];[m] commands for details
      removed the following hint options: 'hintchars' 'maxhints'
      added the following hint options: 'hinttimeout', 'hintmatching', 'wordseperators'
    * IMPORTANT: changed [m]I[m] key to [m]<C-q>[m] to also work in textboxes
    * IMPORTANT: [c]:bmarks[c]! and [c]:history[c]! open the matching items now in a tab, instead
      of bringing up the bookmarks/history window
    * IMPORTANT: [m]B[m] mapping now works just like [c]:buffers[c], old bufferwindow will be removed
      at some time. Use B5gt to jump to the 5th tab.
    * also go to INSERT mode for HTMLSelectElements, so you can type text to go to element
      in drop down boxes
    * new "S" flag for 'complete' to list google suggestions in [c]:open vimp[c] and
      pressing tab (disabled by default). Also added new 'suggestengines' option.
    * [m]gi[m] accepts now a count to jump to the nth input field
    * [m]<C-t>[m] on input fields starts a very basic vi-mode
    * [c]:play[c] for playing a recorded macro
    * [c]:[del]macros [regex][c] for listing/deleting recorded macros
    * [c]:set![c] now lets you change about:config prefs similar to [c]:set[c]
