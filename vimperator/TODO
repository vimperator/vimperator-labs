Priority list:
1-9 as in Vim (9 = required for next release, 5 = would be nice, 1 = probably not)

ARCHITECTURE:
- decide on how to document Arrays in our jsdoc(ish) documentation. Host docs
  on the website - is there even a documentation tool that can parse our source
  sensibly?

  There are a few that can, to some extent. We more or less follow the
  ScriptDoc standard, and we're very close to a few other standards.
  Unfortunately, nearly all of the parsers are lacking in some way, bloated to
  hell, and/or lack support for JS 1.8. --Kris

REFACTORING:
- remove unnecessary usage of "self"

BUGS:
- Class#closure seems to be throwing [Exception... "Could not convert
  JavaScript argument"  nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)"]
  in as yet underdetermined circumstances.
- add window resize support to hints
- searching backwards incrementally does not work i.e. with 'incsearch' set
- insert abbreviations broken on <space>
- :sidebar improvements (:sidebar! Downloads while downloads is open should refocus the sidebar)
- ;s saves the page rather than the image
- RC file is sourced once per window
- :undo seems to be effected by the tabstrip state

(recent CVS regressions):
- visual caret mode is broken, requires a manual page focus first anyway or
  else it chucks, I haven't investigated --djk
- messages is still broken in several ways - needs testing.
  => :ls | :echomsg "Foobar" doesn't add "Foobar" to the already open MOW.
  (NOTE: an intentional design decision by MS - Boo!)
  => it often overwrites the open command line while editing etc.
- <tags> and <keyword> autocmd 'keywords' are not available when adding a
  bookmark - they're being set after the observer triggers the autocmd event.
- :messages is _very_ slow for message history of several thousand lines ->
  Unresponsive Script: util.js:79 (sometimes xmlToDom() and elsewhere)
- The MOW shouldn't close when executing hints and ;F isn't working.

FEATURES:
8 Document Textarea, Caret and Visual modes.
8 Incremental searches should retreat to their starting position on <Backspace>
8 Replace config.name tests in liberator with more specific feature
  tests or overridable APIs where at all feasible.
8 change the extension ID to vimperator@vimperator.org rather than
  vimperator@mozdev.org
8 finish :help TODOs
8 fix local options
8 adaptive timeout for auto-completions, :set completions can be updated more often than
  :open foo
8 use the storage module for autocommands
8 support 'activate' in buffer.followLink?
  Leave this to the bookmarks.tabs.loadInBackground. Hint activation
  should be nearly equivalent to the corresponding mouse motion, and that
  mouse movement would be governed by the FF pref. However, :tabopen is
  something Vimp specific, and so it needs a specific setting (i.e.,
  activate). OTOH, I think it would be better if ";t" *always* opens a
  new foreground tab and ";b" *always* opensa  new background tab. So "F"
  should be the only hint mode that changes based on loadInBackground.
  --Ted
8 add support for filename special characters such as %
8 :redir and 'verbosefile'
8 middleclick in content == p, and if command line is open, paste there the clipboard buffer
8 all search commands should start searching from the top of the visible viewport
8 :addsearch wikpedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s  to allow saving of
  quick searches in the RC file.
  Why not just add a bookmark? --Kris
  This would require performance tests, how fast it is to add 20 keywords that way, as we need
  to search all existing bookmarks to see if the keyword is already defined, and then just update
  that bookmark. --mst

  Wah? I don't see how that's especially relevant, since they only
     need to be added once, but, if you insist:
	:100time bookmarks.getKeywords().some(function(k) k.keyword == "wikipedia")
	  Code execution summary
	  Executed:	100	times
	  Average time:	2.48	msec
	  Total time:	0.25	sec
     --Kris

8 allow for multiple ex commands separated with | (see #24)
8 <C-o>/<C-i> should work as in vim (i.e., save page positions as well as
  locations in the history list).
7 use ctrl-n/p in insert mode for word completion
7 implement QuickFix window based on ItemList
7 wherever possible: get rid of dialogs and ask console-like dialog questions
  or write error prompts directly on the webpage or with :echo()
7 [d could go to the last domain in the history stack. So if I browse from
  google to another page and click 10 links there, [d would take me back to the google page
  opera's fast forward does something like this
7 make an option to disable session saving by default when you close Firefox
7 The output of the pageinfo-command should contain the security-information of ssl-encrypted sites
7 Add :every command
6 :mksession
6 add [count] support to :b* and :tab* commands where missing
6 registers
  Here, unlike Vim, y and "*y would be equivalent. That is, the pasteboard would
  always be the default register. --Ted
6 check/correct spellings in insert mode with some mappings
6 add more autocommands (TabClose, TabOpen, TabChanged etc)
6 jump to the next heading with ]h, next image ]i, previous textbox [t and so on
6 :grep support (needs location list)
6 pipe selected text/link/website to an external command
6 Use ctrl-w+j/k/w to switch between sidebar, content, preview window
6 Command :tags for getting a list of used tags
6 ;?<hint> should show more information
5 when looking at a zoomed out image (because it's large), zi should zoom in
  maybe with this? : http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/content/html/document/public/nsIImageDocument.idl
5 make a command to search within google search results
  (http://gadelkareem.com/2007/01/28/using-google-ajax-api-as-an-array/)
  maybe impossible, needs a per-site key from google
4 } { should jump to the next paragraph of the page
3 A format for 'guitablabel' and 'statusline'
3 add a command-line window (:help cmdline-window in Vim).
3 Splitting Windows with [:sp :vsp ctrl-w,s ctrl-w,v] and closing with [ctrl-w,q], moving with [ctrl-w,w or tab]
  have a look into the split browser extension
1 Add information to liberator/HACKING file about testing and optimization
1 Document remote branches in liberator/HACKING
1 Reformat liberator/HACKING so that git diff can find sections and report changes @ somewhere
- many other ideas are listed in the wiki
