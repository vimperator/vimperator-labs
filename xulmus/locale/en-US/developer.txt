section::Writing{nbsp}documentation[writing-docs,documentation]

For every new feature, writing documentation is _mandatory_ for the patch to
be accepted. The docs are written in
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html[asciidoc] version 8.2.x.
They are placed in the _src/locale/en-US/_ directory and compiled with
_make doc_. Please refer to the
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html[asciidoc documentation] above
for details. Usually you can just write text as is, and mostly it will be
interpreted correctly. The only difficult part is to write special sections
like for help::help[various.html#online-help].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|<F1>| |:help| |:h| |help|
||:h[elp] {subject}|| +
||<F1>||
____________________________________________________________________________
Open help window.
The default section is shown unless {subject} is specified.
If you need help for a specific topic, try [c]:help overview[c].
____________________________________________________________________________
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

is displayed as:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<p><span class="hiddentag">&lt;F1&gt;</span> <span
class="hiddentag">:help</span> <span class="hiddentag">:h</span> <span
class="hiddentag">help</span>

<span class="key">:h[elp] <span class="argument">&#123;subject&#125;</span></span><br />
<span class="key">&lt;F1&gt;</span></p>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="quoteblock-content">
<p>Open help window.
The default section is shown unless <span class="argument">&#123;subject&#125;</span> is specified.
If you need help for a specific topic, try <span class="command">:help overview</span>.</p>
</div></div>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Some notes about the code above:

- *$$|<F1>|$$* defines a _tag_. A tag is written at the right in magenta and let's
  you jump to a topic with [c]:help <F1>[c]. Note that you must write it from
  right to left, so in the above example $$|help|$$ will be the most left tag,
  and $$|<F1>|$$ the most right one.
- *$$||:h[elp] {subject}|| +$$* and *$$||<F1>||$$* define command or mapping
  names and are printed on the left side. Note the + at the end of one
  command, that indicates a new line. There is no general rule when a new line
  is needed and when not, just try it out and see what looks better.
- The actual help code for this command is embedded in at least 4 underscores
  (_). This generates a quoteblock and indents the text so it is more clear
  that it belongs to the command.
- Wrap things in *$$[c]$$* and they are drawn like a :command. Also *$$[o]$$*,
  *$$[m]$$* and *$$[a]$$* are available to markup options, mappings, and
  arguments.
- As a convenience, any string within \{...\} and $$[count]$$ and $$[!]$$ are
  automatically marked up as an argument.

There are also some additional asciidoc commands specifically for writing
Xulmus documentation:

- *$$section::Writing{nbsp}documentation[writing-docs,documentation]$$* Creates
  a new section like _Writing Documentation_ in this help file with 2 tags.
- *$$help:developer{nbsp}information[developer.html#documentation]$$* creates
  a link with text _developer information_ to the tag _documentation_ in
  the file _developer.html_.


If you don't know in which file/section you should put some documentation, ask
on the mailing list or on #vimperator. Usually help should be grouped together
in logically connected subject areas like
help:opening{nbsp}web{nbsp}pages[browsing.html#opening].

section::Generating{nbsp}documentation[generating-docs]

You can also autogenerate most of the asciidoc help after you have written a
new command, mapping or option. For this, use:

  :echo util.generateHelp(commands.get("addons"), "Extra text")

Now you can copy the asciidoc text but always make sure it looks OK after
you compile the help file with "make doc", as the auto-generation might
not work correctly for all special cases.
